## About

![IdleStyle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80020581/143574887-e6e32c3d-3100-4ad8-91d8-f1f8cb612ced.png)

IdleStyle is a Rainmeter skin that offers fully customizable screensavers with custom animation support. Custom animations can be used to display a range of things such as skins, images, and videos. If you want people to notice the fancy side of your desktop, this is a must-have!

## Features

* Flawless Custom Animations
* Light Weight and Easy Manipulation
* Customizable Skin Groups
* Multiple Monitor Support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install IdleStyle by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **IdleStyle** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **IdleStyle**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing IdleStyle.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

## Custom Animations Setup

Now that you've installed and setup IdleStyle, let's begin setting up some modules it comes with!

### Static Backgrounds

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **IdleStyle** from the list and proceed to the **Animation** tab.
3. Enable the custom background preset all the way at the bottom.
3. Go to **Appearance** tab and Under **Customization** press the `DefaultPaper` button besides the `Wallpaper Path` text.
4. Select the custom background you would like to use.
5. Refresh IdleStyle by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.

The background of your screen saver has now been changed. **Please select common file formats such as `.jpg` or `.png`**

### Video Backgrounds



**The other animations, on the other hand, do not necessitate the installation of any additional applications or extensions. So, you can simply enable them using the same method as described above for the Static Backgrounds animation.**

**You can also customize the color scheme for every animation as per need.**
