## About

![IdleStyle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80020581/143574887-e6e32c3d-3100-4ad8-91d8-f1f8cb612ced.png)

IdleStyle is a Rainmeter skin that offers fully customizable screensavers with custom animation support. Custom animations can be used to display a range of things such as skins, images, and videos. If you want people to notice the fancy side of your desktop, this is a must-have!

## Features

* Flawless Custom Animations
* Light Weight and Easy Manipulation
* Customizable Skin Groups
* Multiple Monitor Support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install IdleStyle by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **IdleStyle** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **IdleStyle**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing **IdleStyle**.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

## Custom Animations Setup

Now that you've installed and setup IdleStyle, let's begin setting up some custom animations it comes with!

### Static Backgrounds

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **IdleStyle** from the list and proceed to the **Animation** tab.
3. Enable the custom background preset all the way at the bottom.
3. Go to **Appearance** tab and under **Customization** press the `DefaultPaper` button besides the `Wallpaper Path` text.
4. Select the custom background you would like to use. **Please select common file formats such as `.jpg` or `.png`**
5. Refresh **IdleStyle** by deactivating and activating the toggle on the bottom left.

The background of your screen saver has now been changed. 

### Video Backgrounds

#### Configuring ffplay:

To use video backgrounds, you must first install and configure **ffplay** which is a part of **[ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases).** Follow the instructions below to setup **ffplay**.

1. Open [this link](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip). This link will download a zipped file named `ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip`
2. Extract the zipped file you just downloaded and open the `ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl` folder. Inside, you will find another folder with the same name which will be required in the next step.
3. Open the `ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl` folder, and go into the `bin` folder.
4. Copy the `ffplay.exe` (`CTRL + C`). 
5. Open File Explorer and navigate to `C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\Rainmeter\CoreData\IdleStyle`. **The Windows Drive is typically the `C:` drive, but it may differ for you, so please double-check and navigate to the correct folder.** Also, **please note that `yourusername` here is referring to your PC's username. For example : `C:\Users\Jax\....`**
6. Paste the `ffplay.exe` you copied in **Step 4** into the folder named `IdleStyle` which you opened, on **Step 5**

And that is how you setup **ffplay**. You can now proceed to configure the video backgrounds for IdleStyle. 

#### Setting up the video background:
Follow the steps outlined below to setup custom video backgrounds:

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **IdleStyle** from the list and proceed to the **Animation** tab.
3. Second from the bottom, enable the custom video background preset.
3. Go to **Appearance** tab and under **Customization** press the `DefaultVideo` button besides the `Video Path` text.
4. Choose the custom video background you want to use. **Please select common file formats such as `.mp4`**
5. Refresh **IdleStyle** by deactivating and activating the toggle on the bottom left.

The background of your screen saver has now been changed. 

**The other animations, on the other hand, do not necessitate the installation of any additional applications or extensions. So, you can simply enable them using the same method as described above for the Static Backgrounds animation.**

**You can also customize the color scheme for every animation as per need.**
